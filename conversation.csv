0,1,1,"Yeah. So  I'm hearing, this is a really difficult choices and ways of looking at this decision that you're making, both really important to you. Thinking of those two choices that you're laying out, what is the hardest thing, do you think about that, for you in mak ing this decision?","So I know that there's risk in just going out, right? Of course, there's the safety of having a regular pay check, right? And I'm also tenured. So there's stability. There's also, I think, there's a character at one end here that  my institution has an employee benefit that if my kids are ready for college, they have the ability to apply to about 1500 schools all across the country and get free tuition. So that safety, right? That may not be like income right now but that can trans late into income, right? And then again I know that there's ups and downs with consulting, that there could be a good season here and there could be a bad season there. And so I think the challenge for me before I was like, ""Oh, well, what if I have a bad season?"" Right? What if I am not able to take care of my family? Then that would be like, devastating, what if they became homeless, right?   Because I'm not being able to provide. And so that's been like torn, right? Should I go off and take a risk of not being... Right? Which the flip side of that, of course, I could probably make a lot more, not probably, I know I can, right? And do I let go of this incentive here. And then when it comes to college time, what if I don't provide enough that I'm able to pay  for the kids to go to college? Because I really I want to create this legacy for my family. And I also want to put them in a situation where they are not having to be crippled by student loans and student debt.",,Warren-GEI.csv
1,1,2,And so I am hearing a lot about what w ould be most at risk or most at stake for you in making a wrong decision? Am I hearing what's most at stake for you? Is there anything that's more at stake?,"I think part of it is, of course, there will be a sense of disappointment that I would expe rience personally, but I think that the shame and the disappointment that others will place on me, I guess, is also a motivation, right? I think it would be... I definitely don't want to disappoint my family. So that's something that's important to me. So probably I think a lot of it has to do with the legacy, but I remember how it felt going through that and having to be separated from my brothers and my sister and having to just rely on my aunt to be able to take care of me. And that's something that I've  always like really vowed not to ever have happened. I think it has driven me in many regards. I wanted to be successful. I wanted the independence. I wanted the freedom to be able to do what I wanted to do without having to be controlled by an aunt or a f amily member or be limited by my own financial means.",,Warren-GEI.csv
2,1,3,"And this sounds like a crazy question, but I'll just ask , in terms of you mentioned the disappointment, others being disappointed in you and equating that to shame and what would be the worst thi ng about that for you to be that person or that man who's head of his family? What's that?","Mm-hmm (affirmative). So  I think it comes from early programming, right? I was the fifth of six children and I was the youngest boy. And for some reason my mom always saw me as being the most responsible one. And I think it was a burden that was placed on me to be responsible one  because even in experiencing poverty, I got it from a pretty young age and I knew what it meant for my mom to be struggling. And so I knew that like asking for excess or wasting stuff was not something that made sense. I didn't need to burden her any furt her like all this stuff that was going on.",,Warren-GEI.csv
3,1,4,"Yeah. And so when you think about that, can you see an upside to... Or can you see any time in the future, even now or in the future, where it will be okay to disappoint someone or to disappoint your family?","Yeah. I think that for me, especially in terms of my extended family, I don't think that they have the grip on me as much as they did before. I make decisions now that I think are best for me and that are best for my current family in terms of my wife and kids. To disappoint  my kids and my wife would be a hard one, right? And I think I've got a pattern of good decisions. I think they trust me to make good choices. I trust myself to make good choices. And it is possible certainly a choice that I make may not necessarily turn o ut to be the best one, right? Because the reality is I can't control the outcomes and I can't be attached to the outcomes. I may do what I think is best but then situations beyond my control may happen. I might make an investment, for example, COVID -19 or COVID -20 might occur and it could totally derail stuff.   So that's certainly possible. And if that were to happen for me, I think I would get over it and I could shield myself from any type of judgment that they experience. I feel like I would probably be defensive because I would go back to the fact that I can't control the outcomes that given the information that I had, I did what I thought was best and I think I bounce back pretty easily.",,Warren-GEI.csv
4,1,5,"And can you say hypothetically a situation where whatever de cision you choose, staying or going, moving out to being a consultant, that both would be okay? Or either would be okay?","Yeah, I think so. Because I think that everywhere I get to be a vessel, right? I would just be playing in a different en vironment, right? I would also be working with clients and organizations in schools where the transformation can be just not even more impactful. I'm relying on, right now, teaching the students to teach others, right? To keep the world going. But I think I could do the same thing in terms of  4 organizations as well. I have pretty similar impact during my trainings. I think I have a way of serving as a vessel of transformation. So if I were to go, I think that would be I could certainly take that value with me. And if I were to stay I still consult part time. So I still would get to be in the environment and to be able to express my passion with my students and also express my passion with my external clients as well.",,Warren-GEI.csv
5,1,6,"So I'm hearing such a strong value a round, and connection to purpose, around being a vessel of transformation. How do you know that that's a good way to be or how you want to be? How do you know that?","It is what keeps me up at night. Ideas keep coming to me. And it's not ideas about being rich, it's ideas about how I can really help to support and really help people to see the world differently, especially as it comes to navigating cultural differences and similarities. I'm awake in pretty much every night around 3:30 with like all of  these ideas that are just dying to be birth. I don't know what I would be without these ideas. And it's not something that just started like yesterday, it's ongoing. So I feel like if this is not a calling, then I don't know what a calling is.",,Warren-GEI.csv
6,1,7,"Yeah.  And so follow on from that is like, I know you said, ""I don't know what I would be without sense of that calling."" I just wonder if you could ever see a possibility of being in the world without that?","Yeah. It gives me juice. If that were not, let 's say, God forbid, I were crippled or I were deaf or mute or something or become dumb, I should say, and not being able to fully exercise that, I think I would find a way. It could be through writing. But also I think because I have invested so much in ot her people doing the work because of  teachers who are teaching young minds, then I could still see this work living on, even outside of me. So either way, even if it's not me personally, I think the seeds that I planted will ultimately  germinate.",,Warren-GEI.csv
7,1,8,Okay. Can you see any downside to this wonderful deep calling that you have?,"I think a value that I have that goes alongside that is to be with my family, right? I really enjoy that. And this calling at times requires me to travel or to be in isolation and that is hard for me. I don't want to lose my soul or my commitment to my fam ily while I am working on transforming the world or being the vessel transmission for others, because my first calling is to be a vessel of transformation for my kids. So the downside is sometimes this can be time consuming and, of course, it robs me of sl eep. And sometimes, of course, the kids would pull the guilt trip, ""You are always traveling or how come you can't do this?"" Right? And so it's how to navigate that. How to balance serving others while serving your family and obviously serving yourself.    5 And so self care gets sacrificed sometimes and care with family, of course, gets sacrificed sometimes. So that's the challenge. I think the possible downside is really getting drowned in this and not necessarily being there to support my kids and my famil y, like I need to, emotionally.",,Warren-GEI.csv
8,1,9,Thank you. Do you have another story to tell?,Yeah. So I feel like it was one that was related to that.,,Warren-GEI.csv
9,1,10,What about there's some emotion for the moment? That's okay.,"Yeah, absolutely. And so this is, I think related to that, and is like the institution has taken a very different turn. We got a new president a few years ago and it all of a sudden felt like really just so corporate and what I knew as a great relational s pace to be in now seems like it's about bottom line. In my mind there was a lot of excessive like spending on buildings and stuff that wasn't consistent with the university's prior values of just small classes and that kind of stuff. And that's led to a ma ss exodus of a lot of people, including a lot of people of color. And it's been frustrating for me to watch my colleagues just come and go. We've lost two from my department. So two of my great colleagues have left the institution in the last three weeks. And we just learned the provost, who is also a person of color, just left yesterday. Just announced yesterday he'll be leaving. And just it's hard. It's really hard and it's challenging.",,Warren-GEI.csv
10,1,11,So what's the thing that's hardest or source of that frustratio n that you're feeling?,"I feel like I am really committed to supporting, and again, just be in this vessel of transformation for institutions. But I've always felt like I don't get the same respect in my own town or in my own institution. So I've ch osen to do most of my work outside. And I've just pretty much concluded whenever they're ready is when I'll jump in because they haven't really... I mean, they've paid lip service to the idea of diversity and inclusion. And they haven't treated their peopl e well, especially people of color and we keep losing them and losing them and losing them. So it's not a very inclusive space. But this year I took sabbatical last fall and I came back being more intentional and I said, ""You know what? I'm going to really  do my best to support them.""",,Warren-GEI.csv
11,1,12,"And so what's the, let's say worst thing about this sort of sense that you're getting, the institutions paying lip service to supporting people of color and to diversity and inclusion?","Yeah. The worst thing for me is that the value that I have, right? This deep value for really creating a world that people, despite their differences, can survive and th rive and can have access and be able to be a part of the American dream, that my institution is not... I'm part of an institution that works against that, right? And that I'm complicit by being part of this revolving door where we have African American graduation rate that's... Last statistic I heard is probably barely touching 30%. So we're not serving students well, we're not serving faculty well, we're not serving staff well, especially staff of color.",,Warren-GEI.csv
12,1,13,"Yeah. And what do you hate most about being, i n your words, almost complicit in this situation?","Yeah. I think at some point sometimes I feel a sense of like guilt, like, ""Oh, well, I'm doing all of this great work with these other institutions that they're thriving and I'm not doing the work h ere."" But I think what pains me about that is I feel like they have rejected in many regards, I guess, rejected my  but they've rejected my work because they don't seem to value it as much as these other institutions do. And it feels li ke, ""Do I want to stay and help to clean up this cesspool and really help them to get it? Put all my energies into that? Or do I need to just go ahead and just leave and do my own thing or be a part of an institution that already matches my value?"" And the n I think it comes back to me too, ""But if I leave, other people of color are going to come back into this and it's still going to be the same way for these people as well."" So anyway -",,Warren-GEI.csv
13,1,14,"What does it say about Warren as a leader and somebody who stands  for and deeply cares about diversity and inclusion? What does that say about Warren if he can't deliver in a way, for want of a better word, on that in his own institution?","Yeah. It's a great question. I think that what comes up for me right now i s this adage that I would hear at home a lot, which is the idea that charity begins at home, right? And that your place, your home base, should be where that stuff is exercised. And if I can't be a vessel of transformation in my own home then well, maybe I 'd be a fraud. It's tempting to say it's the home, right? Like, ""Oh, well, it's just the environment of the home that's just so toxic."" And then I go back to, I believe it's somewhere in the Bible that Jesus or someone said that it's hard to get respect in  your own town, right?   Yeah. But I think that given the emotional and the time investment that I placed into this institution, if I were truly committed then I should be able to help them to overcome these obstacles. If I had that transformative impact that I have with other ins titutions then I should be able to do it no matter where  7 or the state or the conditions, because I think about it from a developmental perspective. So I'm supposed to meet institutions and people where they are developmentally and I'm supposed to be able to help them to grow no matter where they are.",,Warren-GEI.csv
14,1,15,"Yeah. And so I stepped back a little bit. I heard you say, ""I should be able to do it."" And I was wondering when you think of the should, the words that are coming to me is like who's laying the should on  you? Is it internal or is it like an external thing?",Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah. I was thinking more in terms internally. So like -,,Warren-GEI.csv
15,1,16,Why?,"Yeah. So  if this is my magic, right? If this is my calling, if this is the juice that I bring to the world that I am this vessel of transformation then that should be able to apply in all contexts, especially the context where I spent so much time, right? So in a sense it makes me question my commitment, right? How committed am I to that work? How committed I am to it? Do I really want to put the time into it? I think part of it comes back to value, right? Like one of the things I struggled with earlier on is they would have me. Well, yeah. They would assign me to teach several different courses and be on several different committees. And being on all of these committees and all of these different courses I was teaching, it really was just burdensome, right?   There was not a lot of like financial rewards for doing it because I'm doing it in the name of the service. And when I calculated that, ""Well, I'm putting all this time on doing all this service and I don't see a lot of changes happening. Is this worth it?"" Wher eas I can work over here and this institution don't have to put in not even a tenth of the time and be reimbursed or compensated quite generously and see the changes occurring, see the differences making the students and faculty into the institutions.",,Warren-GEI.csv
16,1,17,I'm sort of hearing a little bit as though you're getting close to a line being crossed for something where you're needing to make a stand and I was wondering what might that be? What's the line that's possibly being crossed for you Warren?,"I think I want to be valued and I want my work to be valued. I see the value in my work and I see how others external to the institution are valuing it and if I don't sense that it's valued, then I think it dampens my commitment and I shift my commitment to pla ces where the value is.",,Warren-GEI.csv
17,1,18,Yeah. And what's the best thing about the spaces where your work is valued? What's the best thing about that for you?,"I think the best thing about it is I feel like I'm making a difference. I feel like I'm having an impact. I feel like the fruits of my labor are being materialized. I feel like transformation is being actualized. I feel like it provides evidence for me that I'm a vessel of transformation. And I don't know what I do in some regards, especially with re gards to my students, I see the transformation that I get feedback from them a lot. But even if I don't get the feedback, I just know, right?   Like from the experiences, from the seeds that I'm planting, I know that I'm being a vessel of transformation. So metimes the feedback comes a year or two later. I was awarded the teacher of the year. So in some regards, institutionally there was some evidence that at least from a teaching perspective that, that work is being done. And I'm sought out a lot now. I thin k now that I'm becoming more available to really create some stuff. So I hope that this historical moment that there's so much stuff going on, that this provides an opportunity for them to wake up, so that we can [crosstalk 00:37:12]",,Warren-GEI.csv
18,1,19,"Just taking you back, sorry for interrupting, just taking you back to that thing is, getting evidence for the value you bring. And you're getting some of that with your students and it seems like you're not sensing that from the institution in terms of what's not happenin g there. And so how do you know that you're bringing value?",To the institution?,,Warren-GEI.csv
19,1,20,"Just in the work that you do, and you had a little bit in there, some spaces where you do feel it, just easily without getting it from others or are there other w ays or how do you know that you're bringing value?","Yeah, so it comes two ways. I think I can feel the value that I am expressing and that I'm bringing through the flow of content, the ideas that I'm generating, the insights that I'm providing. But that becomes validated also from comments that I get from o ther people. I think certainly the teacher of the year was an external validation, right? That's the highest teaching award on a university's campus. And I think I'm always looking for something new, some new insights, some new way of thinking about or som e way of organizing as a way of bringing value to my clients and to my students. I want them to get it. And so when I'm able to generate this new stuff, stuff that I'm working on, I have like a thousand different projects that I'm working right now, they'r e like ""Uh, this'll be good.""   That will really help them to be able to see and to experience this transformation for themselves. And so that gives me juice and that's evidence for me, right? The more I'm able to kind of come up with stuff, right? Really c ool interesting stuff to try out. And other ways, of course, will be invitations like out of the blue from certain people or certain companies or certain reach outs will be a way that, ""Oh, well, I'm sought out this way because of the value that I bring to  them as well.""",,Warren-GEI.csv
20,1,21,"So, I'm hearing a little bit, you get sort of a sense of it in your body almost when you're getting that, having experience with your students and there's something new that's going to actually support them to get involved in course. And there's also like validation through the external, the awards and things like that, what do you think really is most important to you?","I love coming up with new stuff. Not all the ideas are going to work. Like half of them or more never come up  with anything, right? Almost anything. But it gives me juice. Sometimes I'm like, I mean, I have the shakes, right? I can definitely feel it in my body and I'm like, ""Oh my gosh. I want to be able to wake my wife up in the middle of the night. I can't wai t for her to wake up or I can't wait for her to get off the phone because I want to share this stuff."" Right? This... Wow. What do you think about this? What do you think about this idea? And again, this is because I think the impact that these ideas can h ave on people is what drives me. So I think that's probably most importantly, how do I be the best vessel that I can be for others? What new ideas can I generate so I can catalyze transformation for other people?",,Warren-GEI.csv
21,1,22,"And can you see that ever sort of cha nging like this drive and this energy that you've got for being the best you can be to deliver on this deep purpose that you have, can you see a situation where that might change, that might not be true for you?","Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think in som e regards I'm equating it to somehow when I used to run track, right? I used to run from me because I really knew that I was supposed to be Barbados first Olympian, right? But in many regards also it was for me pleasing my spectators, right? Making my spec tators happy, right? And so when I became injured then it was like, ""Uh -uh (negative)"", right? Important sense of who I am was not necessarily there, right? Because part of me... We are interconnected, right? So I am connected to my spectators. I'm connect ed to the audience. And so if I were to not be able to do this, part of that would be, well, these ways of seeing and being in the world that others got to experience as a result of me would be gone and that would be a loss for the world, right?   It woul d be a loss for me as well, but I am sure that as long as I have breath I would still be thinking about what can I do? What can I generate? Even if I could not physically deliver it, I would still be thinking about who can I train? What can I do? What can I share? What can I write so that I can be that vessel?",,Warren-GEI.csv
22,1,23,Thank you. Do you have another story? We've got a few more minutes. If you have the energy for that.,"Yeah, absolutely. I wonder if this is helpful. This is also related.   So I learned to day that one of the department, that's like a sister department for us, they have a vacancy. A person who I highly respect is actually stepping down. She's going to be part of the institution, but not going to be in the leadership role. And I learned that one of the faculty members,  10 one of the people who's applied for the position, one of the finalists, is my very first enemy. And you asked me to think about hate. She would probably be the only person that I would even remotely close to using the word hate with.",,Warren-GEI.csv
23,1,24,I don't think I used hate but that's what's up for you. That's fine. Go with it.,"Wow. To the extent that I honestly told my wife tonight that if she is hired, I will be submitting my resignation right away. It would be really hard working with her. I know I'm not the only person who feels this way because there are some other people who communicated to my Dean and other folks. And I think there's a lot of stuff there that I struggle with.",,Warren-GEI.csv
24,1,25,Yeah. So what would be the hardest thi ng about working with her? What would be the most hard thing?,"Gosh, she is disingenuous. She's all about self aggrandizement. She doesn't have a, I don't know, a sense of loyalty. She's not very collaborative. All things that I obviously value, rig ht? The flip side of those, things that I highly value. But it stem from... I took groups to overseas. So I took a group of students to Barbados and I asked her to accompany me to be my co -leader because there were primarily females and we need to have a c o-leader anyway. She was new to the university and they felt like, ""Oh, we're going to see in unit, going to be good friends together."" When we got there I took, my wife who was at the time my fiance with me, but we still maintained boundaries at that time  because we were engaged and we were practicing celibacy. I asked the co -leader if she would be okay with my fiance staying in a room with her and I would just stay by myself.   Nonetheless while we were there, a lot of stuff came up around the trip. We were supposed to be equally partners in this trip. And one of the things that came up was the university's credit card declined like more than once after hours, like with some real ly critical events. I didn't want the students to know what was going on. And so I pretty much had to deplete all of my cash reserves in order to even get students spent. And there was one situation that came up where the card declined again and I asked he r to just kind of keep the students so that I can kind of like figure out... First of all I asked her if she had any cash that she would be willing to share and she said, ""No."" Right? And I'm calling back to university, this is the weekend, nothing can hap pen basically. So I had to go and try to figure out how I was going to get some funds from my family so I can feed the students. And I didn't want the students to know.",,Warren-GEI.csv
25,1,26,Yeah. That sounds like such a hard situation. So fast forwarding to now and this person's coming to work with you -,Yes. So basically -,,Warren-GEI.csv
26,1,27,11 So what is the thing that's really making this so hard for you?,"Yeah. I felt betrayed by her in that situation as well as many other subsequent situations. Because rather than kind of shield me or be a partner with me on this, she basically created this narrative so that she could look good in the eyes of students and that I could look like a villain. So she told my boss for example, that I left her with the students without anything  to eat while I just went off gallivanting with my fiance.",,Warren-GEI.csv
27,1,28,"So what was most at risk for you then? And like, I think we need to bring it back to now. What do you feel now? What's most at risk for you here?","Yeah. I feel like working with her wi ll resurface, it's already resurfacing, right? Some of those emotions. I feel like it could be... I don't know if I can work beside her. I'm already concerned that the institution is not necessarily the most collaborative space and that it doesn't create a  culture that is healthy for people, especially people of color and to bring her in I feel like it will be evidence that, ""Look, here we go again."" Right? Bringing in someone else is going to leave this institution or at least this unit, down a road that's  going to be just as unhealthy for people of color.",,Warren-GEI.csv
28,1,29,"And so this is a hypothetical kind of question, like can you see an upside to this situation with her right now?",The only upside that I can see is that the other two candidates are pretty pl ausible. And that there will be  the other two as opposed to her.,,Warren-GEI.csv
29,1,30,Okay. So she hasn't been given the position yet?,Right.,,Warren-GEI.csv
30,1,31,"Right. Okay, I misunderstood. Yeah. Anything else good if it could go for you? Could come out of this , coming out of this right now?","I guess this is like a huge stretch. But since I have this calling to be a vessel of transformation, this could be a place where I could develop the capacity to forgive and it could tran slate into a healthy working relationship where I help her to support transformation because that division has a lot of impact statewide. They do a lot of grant writing and they do a lot of work with students. Yeah. So I could  12 become a vessel of transforma tion and support her in really making a difference statewide. And that was a stretch.",,Warren-GEI.csv
31,1,32,Fair enough.,That would require a lot of coaching from you Anne.,,Warren-GEI.csv
32,1,33,"Okay. So  we've covered a few stories and there's a theme around you're bringing value and being of value and being recognized for that in a healthy way, wherever you are. In order to be the vessel of transformation that you want to be. If you had a magic world, an d could truly be that in the world, what would that mean for you?",If I can be a vessel of transformation in the world?,,Warren-GEI.csv
33,1,34,Mm-hmm (affirmative).,"I will be traveling. I will be living a bi global lifestyle partly here and bringing transformation not only to the west but also to be able to go back and give back and support transformation there, especially in this time where people are struggling to make sense of life and make sense of the world. That I would be working with people wh o have a really hard time navigating cultural differences and that through dialogues and through collaborations and through relationship building, I get to grow as well as help others grow. I would gain a better sense of their perspective and why they stru ggle with differences, especially racial differences. But I also help them to expand their perspective, their worldview, and so that they can have a more meaningful and substantive experience with people who just look different.

ridden and guilt - producing and I can’t tell you what a number religion has done on me So for years, from until I was , I went to parochial schools and a Jesuit high school, and I got a sense of what liberation was when I went on to the University _____________ But from to I was going to confession and really really counting all of my impure thoughts really compulsively and for me I didn’t know what an impure thought was I thought just a flicker of an idea of the hair on a man's leg was an impure thought That was mortally sinful, it would send me to hell for my, for eternity And so I was scared and I didn’t want to go out and be with men because I would see them, I might look at their crotch or I might think of the hair under their arms and it was sinful In this warped idea that I had And there wasn’t anybody there to correct this, this notion because I didn’t really want to talk to anybody about it But it began welling up It was so intense that the, that I had to tell somebody And the only person I knew well enough to tell was my mother So I would tell her about the preoccupations I had, or the worries I had and she kept on saying oh, it will go away, don’ t worry about it I don't know how she dealt with it all those years Because like every three or four days I would have to go up to her and tell her and she would like kind of kiss the wound and put a band - aid on it, and ever run away Finally I went to the University ____________ and all through high school it was terrible It was so remote, I just couldn’t relate to it, to the rest of the boys at all It was like years of not talking to anybody while I watched everybody else make friends and walked down the hallway and having a good time and I was there alone At that time I just read and I did my school work and day - d reamed an awful lot and it would take me hours to go through my studies because I was preoccupied with different things What a relief it was to get away from the house and to go out to __________ and there it was coeducational, so it was real nice Finally I was with women that I felt much more comfortable with and these weren’t Catholics, these were Jews, who were liberal, who were from ____ _____ who were exposed to different things I felt suddenly that there was acceptance, there was warmth, there was fresh air, there was some kind of difference and they were all very attractive people, also I made a point of surrounding myself with really attractive friends, who were intelligent and physically beautiful and entertaining and politically alive And I joined the Committee to End the War, and worked actively in that Not as actively as some, but fairly actively for me for someone who is kind of timid And the, I felt finally unified with a group Of course, it wasn’t a group of what my mother would call my own, there wasn’t a Catholic in the bunch And fine, I had had enough of Catholics my whole life I spent four interesting years there Not all good times, but some very good times My first two years I think were probably the most interesting and the last two, they had a lot of moments of depression in those last two years, however it was better than high school I met a girl my senior year, she was Jewish and from ________ and we lived together for a while and I went up to the University of _ _______ the next year and I asked her to come up and visit me during the summer, she came up and I told her T my religion has been such a big part of my past, I would like you and I just to go to Mass, so you can see what I have gone through Maybe the church has changed a bit You know what they talked about that Sunday",,SOI-Interview-7-2014-POST-1.csv

This is a Growth Edge Interview with Craig, who has volunteered to be interviewed so the rest of the community can see a Growth Edge Interview in its entirety. I gave Craig the instructions in advance, so I'm just going to say just a couple of things Craig, and then we'll get started. Is that all right?",Absolutely.,,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
131,4,2,"The general guidelines here are that I just ask you to start talking about one of the stories that you cam e up with in your prompt. I will listen, then I may, sometimes, interrupt you because what I'm listening for is I'm actually trying to listen really, really deeply to not so much the story, but the meaning that you are making. I'm trying to see the world through your eyes.","Absolutely. In fact, on the front end, you may want to ask som e clarifying questions because unfortunately, my story is less of a narrative arch, and more of a life circumstance. So if there are any clarifications that would be helpful, feel free to... insert those.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
132,4,3,"Okay. I will definitely do that. We'll jus t see how it goes. If at any point during the conversation, we're going in a direction that you don't want to go, you're in charge.",Okay.,,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
133,4,4,Okay. All right.,Great.,,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
134,4,5,All right. So just go ahead. Start talking.,"Sure. A lit tle bit of context. Well, first and foremost, I'm a father. I have a 13 year old daughter and a 9 year old son. I think one of my professional challenges has been to work out what It looks like to bring the love and the connection, in the sense of truth and honesty, that I have the privilege of sharing with my children and my family, into my professional work. So I am an executive in the federal government, in Washington, D.C. As a career executive, I get to work very closely with the politicals. And right now, I am at the Department of Education.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
135,4,6,"Thank you so much for that. So it sounds like... The couple things I've heard is that there are some really, really important  values that you hold, that it's been important for you to bring... You hold them in your life, and it's been really important to bring them into the professional space. And the challenge in doing that has gotten harder, given the circumstances. And you've  been surprised by the unexpected opportunities that have emerged as a result of engaging in that. Is that right?","I think that's a good summary, yeah.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
136,4,7,And one of the challenges that comes out of that is that now you've got more opportunitie s than... It's getting hard to kind of pursue those opportunities and stay true to the values that are important to you. Is that right?,"I wouldn't say it's... It's not that it's hard to stay true to the values, 'cause in a sense, it's the values. Th e behaviors that flow from those values that has led to this unexpected circumstance, but the thing that I think I'm trying to work out is, is the logic that I might use to navigate my choices moving forward around which opportunities I'm going to pursue, and what it looks like to... a little more concrete. So I'm in a position right now where I'm a fairly senior person in office. I'm like the Chief People Officer for an office, and I get to do all sorts of fun things, and basically, make up the job around what the culture and climate, and people needs of the organization are. It's really fun.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
137,4,8,"Yeah. So I'm curious. What is the hardest thing for you about having so many opportunities, and having to make choices?","I think the hardest thing is this sense of loyalty that I  began to develop for people through... Part of how I lead is through cultivating trust, and almost radical human connection. And that's one thing that I think I brought from my coaching into this non -coaching professional space as a manager and a leader, is in coaching, I often sometimes call it assumed familiarity. It's this idea that as a coach, you have the privilege to be able to bring up, in a really deeply honest and completely non -judgemental way, topics or issues that someone might not even talk ab out with their spouse or their children, right?",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
138,4,9,So what would be the worst thing for you about feeling like you betrayed that?,"I guess, it's a good problem to ha ve. I feel like it's complex, it's a good problem to have. And I feel like there aren't any terrible outcomes, maybe the most challenging thing would be if the people that I have in mind actually did feel betrayed. And even that might be an opportunity in the sense that their sense of betrayal is something that, using radical compassionate honesty, we could talk about, and reestablish that sense of trust.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
139,4,10,"So it sounds like that the anxiety -producing thing is the worry that you might be a person who betrayed this co re thing that matters to you, which is this radical, human, trusting connection that you have with another person. So if you were to do something, make a choice that was experienced by the other person as having betrayed that [crosstalk 00:10:51] -","Yeah. I think that would be hard. And the other thing that might be hard about it is that of course, the source of good things happening in the work relationship is that very trust. So given that none of the opportunities are going to take me outside of thi s sphere of my current work partnerships and relationships, I wouldn't want to do anything to cause difficulty downstream around continuing to have those kinds of outstanding results that we've been seeing, as a byproduct of this relationship. Does that ma ke sense?    Transcript by Rev.com  ",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
140,4,11,"Yeah. So I'm kind of hearing two things, and I'm curious about which one feels more at stake for you, in this. So if you were to make a choice that felt like you were betraying that kind of core human connection that you're so privileged to get in your work, and it's so important to you, one of the things that might be at stake is that you might just be... the feeling of being a person who didn't live into this thing that you say is so important to you.","Essentially, yeah.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
141,4,12,Yeah. [crosstalk 00:12:13] -,"I guess it's actually a little hard to prioritize. As I was thinking about preparing for this interview, one of the things that came up for me in my gut, is that well, it's maybe just not a problem actually, at all.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
142,4,13,Which part of it is maybe not a problem at all?,"Oh, well, the worry and the fear; this sort of logical... Your question was oriented towards driving me to the logical. “What's the worst thing that can happen as a result of this?” And I just thought it was important to throw out that at the same time, I kind of am aware of those automatic thoughts. They're probably anxiety driven. I'm also simultaneously aware that whether they're true or not is probably a totally separate matter.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
143,4,14,So I'd actually like to go back to the values themselves. Is that okay?,"Sure, absolutely.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
144,4,15,"You started the conversation naming four things that I heard. One was love... There was love, connection, truth and honesty.

145,4,16,Did I hear that right?,Absolutely. Yeah.,,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
146,4,17,So I am curious. What is most important to you about bringing those valued into your workplace?,"I guess it's partly informed by personal experience. Being in the federal government for 17 years, I've had plenty of opportunity to work and lead different groups of people,   Transcript by Rev.com    where it's fair to say that the organizational morale, and sort of, sense of orga nizational cohesion, and culture, and effectiveness was incredibly low. Incredibly low. To the point of people being painfully disengaged, except for with their analytical work. And on some level, probably not even aware that that was the condition they we re showing up in everyday.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
147,4,18,"So now you've had that experience, and you saw that it really, I assume, made a big difference.","It made a huge difference, yeah.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
148,4,19,"So fast forwarding to today, in your current situation. What would be at stak e for you if you couldn't be the... kind of the embodiment, or the carrier of that set of values into your workplace?","It's a interesting idea. If I couldn't... I'm trying to imagine what that looks like because even under the most challenging of cir cumstances, I've been able to. I've come to think of that work actually, as almost a quiet revolution. In some ways, the central challenge of, I'm showing up at work as being yourself; regardless of the circumstance that you are in. And not allowing that c ircumstance to define who it is that you're being, but rather to continue to be yourself in an authentic way.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
149,4,20,"That's okay. All answers are accepted. And also, you've got me curious. So it sounds li ke it's really important to you to not only talk about being human at work, but to be that. You work really hard to find ways to do that, even when it's not easy.","Totally. In fact, I don't like to talk about it at work. I like to be it and allow tha t to create the results I'm looking for without talking about it. 'Cause in a sense, talking about it is cheating.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
150,4,21,"What's cheating about talking about it? Why is talking about it bad, and being it good?","I talk about it in coaching settings,  but in work settings, it almost feels like it's so easy and convenient to talk about these things, but it's really difficult to do them and practice them. So the practice... I'm a big fan of the idea that thoughts can drive behaviors, but it's much easier  for the behaviors to drive the thoughts, and then the thoughts catch up with behaviors. So the behaviors are really what's most important to me, and kind of leaning into, and living into those behaviors; even if it feels uncomfortable. Or even if nobody e lse is doing it. Or regardless of the power dynamics of the relationship, or whatever the circumstances might be that could pull you out of that. Does that make sense?",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
151,4,22,Yeah. So does that feel like kind of a goal for you? To help create an environm ent where people can be human and also do it more than talk about it?,"Yeah, absolutely. And I think, in fact, what I've noticed is that... and through doing some of the adult development work, is that not everybody's going to talk about it; not ever ybody's even going to be aware of it. But if you show up in a certain way, you can achieve incremental shifts in how other people are showing up, just by how you show up.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
152,4,23,"Yeah. And when you don't manage to show up the way you want to, what's that like for you?","I tend to get anxious about it. How do you measure that? I don't really know if I ever do. My sense is that... There are certainly days when it feels that way, and [crosstalk 00:21:14] -",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
153,4,24,That you're not showing up the way -,"Exactly. At the same time I guess, I'm aware that there's not really a measure of that, except in the gift of other people's feedback, right? It's all relational. All of the evidence of how you're showing up is manifesting in other people. Right?",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
154,4,25,"Yeah. So you get that kind of... If you're paying attention, you can notice the impact that you're having on other people.",Exactly.    Transcript by Rev.com  ,,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
155,4,26,Is that right?,"It's needed. It's almost like a tightrope walk, or you're doing a practice of. .. like walking meditation practice, and it's like, “Oh, I got pulled up into my head. Time to settle back down into my toes and my heels, and my breathing, and my core. And Oh, back up in the head.” It's not like you ever arrive, right? It's something tha t you continuously will work on.

157,4,28,"So on those days when you're feeling harder on yourself, what's the thing that you're not doing, or is not... What are you falling short of at those times? Does that make sense as a question?","It does. I think maybe... So if I look across the pattern of those days, maybe what first comes to mind is that... I didn't know this until I was in my 30s, but my dad has brothers and sisters, and literally, every single one of them have social anxiety. So I have a strong genetic pre disposition to anxiety, and I know what it feels like to have a significant amount of anxiousness in my nervous system. I have tools to manage that. But one of the things that tends to happen when I start to feel anxious is that I get pushed up into my hea d, and I start to have these racing thoughts. So I think in some way, the evidence of the kind of day that you're talking about is when that's happening.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
158,4,29,Yeah. In those moments when you're having one of those  days where you realize you're not kind of being who you want to be on behalf of the change that you want to make.,I think it's mostly that kind of physical nervous system manifestation that happens.

160,4,31,What's the best thing about it?    Transcript by Rev.com  ,"Well, first, it keeps you very humble. In some ways, it keeps you grounded in your heart because after all, it is your nervous system that is bringing the anxiety there. Usually, I'm aware enou gh of it happening that I can actually pause and kind of step outside of it. And through asking my son, who's nine, ""Hi sweetie. How was your day today?"" And in talking, and kind of getting in that, usually, I can bypass it and kind of side track it. It's harder in my relationship with my wife. With other adults, it's harder. Kids tend to be very heart -centered, and they'll just pull you right down into their . I don't know if that resonates for you.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
161,4,32,"Oh, yeah. I bet it resonates  for plenty of people who are listening to this. I'm really curious. This might sound like a dumb question, but why is humble and grounded better than not humble and grounded? 'Cause you said... I asked you what might be the best thing about that thing tha t happens, the anxiety, and you said, “Well because it keeps me humble and grounded.” Why is that better than anything else?","Well, I think it helps me pay less attention to myself. It helps me realize that the brain is just a thought secreting gland , and what's most important at any given moment is not the circumstantial thought that the conditions of your life happen to produce in that moment, but the actual human beings that are around you. So in some way, anxiety is a reminder, almost like a stop sign, to pay attention to them, and to get back into the heart -space, and to get back down into that place of really kind of... You can't say you're always successful at it, but at least the intention for there to be this kind of radical connection.  Caroly n:Yeah. So the humility and the groundedness enables you to get back to this heart -space, which is so important for everything you care about.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
162,4,33,"So you've just given me a whole bunch of reasons why... or an answer to a question I was going to ask, which i s why is the heart -space a better place that you want to be? And it sounds like the non -judgemental heart -space helps you navigate really tricky territory. That's one piece.",Totally. Yep.,,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
163,4,34,"Are there any other reasons why this heart -space, this non -judgemental heart -space feels to you, like the way that you're to be?    Transcript by Rev.com  ","Yeah. So I think maybe there's an ego interest. I mentioned earlier that I want to navigate this transition from my current career into coaching. So I see th is last two or three years, or however long... I have to remind myself you can't push the river  don't know what's going to happen when, it just sort of emerges. But the thing that I'm working on intentionally is really coaching presenc e, and a deeper sense of self so that at some point, when I can... I think of my current career, in some ways, as being... I'm a father, I'm the main bread -winner for the family. My wife's a school teacher, so there's not a whole lot of choice about what I 'm doing.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
164,4,35,Mm-hmm (affirmative).,"This is one of those practices that you start where you are. So getting back to your question, I think part of what I'm trying to be intentional about is... I guess I'm aware that I'll be a better coach, and I'll be happier coaching, and I'll be more effective in this, what I think if as my life's work, in connection with other people, if I am on this past, and if I'm intentionally doing this work of... And that's what my intuition tells me; that the heart -work, and the kind of, pushing into that space, that you can pivot from and connect with other people m ore easily. That is the work in a sense.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
165,4,36,"Yeah. It sounds like you have so much experience seeing that being heart -centered, non - judgemental, connection -oriented, not only as useful in your work, it makes you a good coach. It also makes you a happy coach, and it has made you successful. And it sounds like happy in your other work as well as a leader in an organization. So what could be bad about that? And I'm curious. Is there any bad thing about... or badder... Is there any downside to this orientation?","Sure. Absolutely. So professionally, my training is I'm a lawyer. And I think that as I've gone further down this path of kind of prioritizing different things in what I'm paying attention to and how I'm showing up, my capacity at any given moment, for th at kind of really clean, analytical, precise left -brain kind of approach, it's not that it's inaccessible, but because it's not what I'm focused on, and relating to my work through, it can be a little harder to bring that online. It's almost like there's a  gear you have to switch in your brain, and it takes energy to change gears.    Transcript by Rev.com  ",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
166,4,37,Yeah.,"So that's definitely one downside. And a lot of times, I'm working on technical issues that require me to bring that part of myself online. So it's kind of g etting used to that gymnastics of switching gears and saying, ""I need to be in this other part of my brain for a little while.""",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
167,4,38,"What's the hardest thing for you about that? Either one, you pick. Either having trouble switching into that gear that was once your home -base? Or what's hardest about just having to do these mental gymnastics?","I think it depletes my energy to do it. Then when my energy's depleted, I'm probably more prone to feeling anxious. Not that I've ever experienced any of the se things.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
168,4,39,"You just imagined that it might actually trigger that, the anxiety of it.",Yeah.,,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
169,4,40,Yeah.,"And then there's more work around managing the anxiety, which you have to do when your energy's already lower. So it's a spiral  that can get easy to sort of be pulled in to. And the only way out of it is through the heart and through your awareness.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
170,4,41,So can you imagine anything good about being pulled into the anxiety?,"Yeah, totally. Like I said, I think there are g ifts... Having lived with the anxiety, I feel like... So this shows up a lot actually, in my... as dad. And I'm worried, on some level, that genetic predisposition anxiety is going to manifest in my children. And what dad doesn't wear his heart on his slee ve when it comes to his children. The last thing you want to see is your children suffer and have to make sense of that kind of nervous -system based challenge that is so hard to make sense of with a nine year old brain.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
171,4,42,"Well, I don't know. H ere's how it's making sense to me. That while you don't wish the anxiety on anyone, most importantly, your kids, that you see it as... the gift of it has been that it's kind of required you, in trying to find ways to manage it, to find places in you that h ave a lot of meaning. So it's really, in some ways, necessarily brought you to this relationship, heart, humble, grounded orientation to the world.",Totally.,,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
172,4,43,"And when it comes up, the anxiety, it reminds you. So it's almost like the gift tha t keeps on giving. Even as you're trying to reduce the anxiety, it keeps giving you the gift of orienting you toward the thing that you care about.","I think that's right. It actually reminds me a lot of... I have several friends who got to their coac hing path through addiction. They think of their addiction as the great gift, and that's how they will talk about it. I think in some ways, the anxiety is a little bit like that. It's always tied to you. I think it's also a reminder that it's okay to be im perfect. It's okay to be incomplete; we all are, right?",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
173,4,44,Yes we are.,"And the anxiety is almost like a little reminder that... Some people have a bracelet, or a ring or something, to remind them of... “Am I going to say no to three things tod ay?” Or whatever it might be. But the anxiety, in a sense, is almost like... The way I try to think about it is it's almost like that it's built in, a physiological reminder of what's most important.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
174,4,45,"So if the anxiety did not carry with it this as pect of being a gift that keeps you kind of oriented toward what you care about, if it didn't have that gift, how would you view it then? I know that probably a really hard question.",It would suck.,,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
175,4,46,"I guess what I'm wondering, is there anyth ing else good about it other than that it's a reminder? It helps keep you kind of on the path that you want to be on, which is this heart where you're not judgemental, or [crosstalk 00:40:52] -","I think maybe more physiologically maybe. I think that i t does actually make me have heightened sensitivity. So I think that heightened sensitivity is really useful; a tool in coaching and in relationship with other people because I'm used to paying attention to what's happening in my body, right? So that kind of practice of paying attention to what's happening in your body is so helpful in conversation with other people because you can judge much clearer when you have that kid of real connection, and what's possible, and... It's just so much easier to... When y ou're aware of what other people's   Transcript by Rev.com    feelings states are, on some level, even if it's your intuition telling you that, and you're holding it lightly, it opens up all kinds of opportunities.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
176,4,47,So it's useful in any number of ways.,It's very useful.,,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
177,4,48,"Yeah. Okay. I just want to do a process check because we've, as we do in these interviews, moved from your initial kind of, what's up for you, which was about these opportunities and how you make choices. Now we've moved to something that might seem completely unrelated; although, usually it's not. Usually it's not completely unrelated. Is there another topic that you would like to explore? Do you want to go back to that question? Or is there something completely different?","The only other thing... I think it's connected to all if this. My gut and my intuition tell me that the work that I'm doing now is leading to this future path of the next thing, that professionally, that will happen in my life, but in some sense, right now, I'm wor king that out on trust. And since I have little children at home, and my wife is a school teacher, I do feel this kind of responsibility to be making money, and the bread -winner. It's a very practical, kind of worldly concern, but when I think about that t ransition, it makes me worry. What is it going to look like, professionally, for me to do this in a way that will enable me to continue in this really important role that I play, which is part of one little slice of being dad, right?",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
178,4,49,"So what's the  biggest worry? I can make up any number of things that you might actually be most worried about, but what is it?","I guess it's just this worry about... It's like the imposter syndrome thing, right? It's like, “Well maybe when I'm really out there, a nd this is where my real bread and butter is going to come from. Maybe I'm not what I think I am.” Or, “Even if I am that thing, maybe the phone calls won't happen, and the contracts won't be in place.” I keep hearing from people like Bob Anderson, that lo ts of corporations are really interested in shifting into the creative mind, right? But knowing that, and actually living into it and believing as your way of professionally, kind of identifying the rest of the world, is a different thing.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
179,4,50,"So if y ou had to choose, are you more worried that you won't be able to provide? In the worst case, you won't be able to provide for your family? Are, or you more worried that you might find out that this thing that you say you're really committed to, and feel re ally committed to, you might not be able to do it well enough?","I think it's both of those. It's a mixture of both of those. It's almost impossible to pull them apart. I think my childhood was sort of... My dad was a janitor, and my mom was a secreta ry, so we didn't have a lot of sense of financial security growing up. So I have these deep kind of money issues. That fear of, ""Maybe I won't be able to provide for my family."" That's pretty deep in my ... I'm almost 50, and I've been carrying that around  since I was probably... I don't know. In utero.    Transcript by Rev.com  ",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
180,4,51,"That is a big burden, and also, probably one that a lot of people share with you. So you have, up until now, been able to provide for your family.","Absolutely. It's not that this is a rational  thing. It's the thought that is kind of... overtakes me, when I start to contemplate this transition. There are other thoughts, obviously. There are things I'm doing, practical, real things that I'm doing to push into that next space. So joining the Georg etown faculty for the coaching program, and I'm contemplating pursuing my MCC, doing this program, learning adult development, all of these things are kind of a suite of things that... It's almost like I have what I do at work, then there's this... Somebod y said to me the other day, “You have this whole other life you're living.""",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
181,4,52,"Yeah. I'm wondering how you do it all. So you're doing all these things, in part, to ensure that you'll be able to provide for your family when you make the switch? Or is it to ensure that you won't find out that you're not up to the task? Again, I know. It's a hard question. Sorry.","In a sense, doing these things, I feel like... Another value that's super important to me is integrity. And this gets back to what I was  saying about not talking about something, but doing it. So for me, I guess professionally, and as a coach, if that's what I'm going to do, and I believe that's what I'm called to do. So the challenge is to figure out what it looks like to do it. So I'm st epping into that calling, right? And I guess part of the path is just to manage these things that come up in my brain; whether they're true or not. And to find the gifts in them and to use them in ways that help facilitate the movement.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
182,4,53,To know when we're feeling judged anyway.,"Exactly. Know when we're feeling judged. Maybe it's that we're just expert at finding the evidence of that, 'cause that's what we're looking for. But I don't know. It just feels like... I aspire to one thing, and it 's not here yet. I'm doing it part -time, sort of now, but I also aspire to be this other thing, professionally.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
183,4,54,Do you mind if I explore this thing about integrity for just a minute? We -,Absolutely.,,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
184,4,55,... have maybe five to eight mor e minutes. Is that okay?,Sure. Yeah.,,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
185,4,56,"So what I think I'm hearing is that integrity is not just talking the talk, but it's also walking the walk. And that's from earlier in the conversation. Then you brought it up   Transcript by Rev.com    again when I asked you abou t doing all these things to prepare yourself. Is it to ensure you'll be successful, so you can provide financially? Or is it to kind of ensure that you don't find out that you're not really up to the task? So did I also hear that integrity has something to  do with knowing what you're talking about, and not just pretending? Not just saying you know what you're talking about?","Yeah. My sense is that professionally... A lot of the success is a byproduct of actually knowing what you're talking about, and having other people experience you in a certain way. That's the source of the success. So in a sense, it connects back to the question you asked about why is the heart -work so important, and what's so important about love? It's just a different playing fie ld. In a sense, it's the same work, it's just a different playing fields. And the stakes change a little bit because of having a secured income, I'll have this other challenge of figuring out what it looks like to still do this work, but also have it be th e source of my income, instead of... Does that make sense?",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv
186,4,57,"Well I'm not sure. I'm going to ask. So what's different for you as you think about doing this as kind of an extra thing that you're doing? All this coaching work. And as you imagine it be ing your job? What feels differently at stake for you, I guess, in the second, versus the first?","I guess it depends on the day. Some days it doesn't feel different at all. It just feels like, ""Well that's just an extension of the things that I'm doi ng now. And the source of how I show up at work is the way I am with my kids, and all the work I've been doing with love, and my values, and other things. So it's not any different actually, it's just a different chapter, same project. But I think where th e anxiety takes me is that... Well, right now, I have a source of income from my savings, and I know where my mortgage is going to come from.",,Craig-Carolyn-GEI-Transcript.csv

189,4,60,Yeah.    Transcript by Rev.com  ,"I think it probably already been said. A mentor of mine, I call him my Sherpa, once said to me, “Craig, it's all going to be fine.

I've seen the growth of the body of knowledge from something that is peripheral, to something that more central, right? So part of what you're doing there, is talking about  it in a ways that makes it central, intentionally. Everybody wants, deep down... I see this in my son, and my daughter; everybody wants to matter. Everybody wants to have that sense of, what they're bringing is relevant and important.

313,6,10,... How do you know what actually matters?,"Well, this is just my own compass, but where  I was beginning to go is attention matters to me. Attention matters to me, and I think it matters big time in the world, otherwise media companies, social media in particular, wouldn't it be buying for our attention so much? Attention may be the costliest  resource that we have. It's time on earth where we get to focus on what we choose to focus on, and if we're faking ourselves out and I'm coming up with obstacles to that, focusing on obstacles to that ... I'm feeling like a zealot as I'm saying this, but it's like we're hating the gift of life.",,Gideon-Patrice-GEI-Transcript.csv
314,6,11,"So when you perceive that someone else is distributing their attention to things that seem trivial, like  when they're kind of explaining or making excuses, for you, it feels like they' re putting attention to things that are minor, which was taking away some  they could be paying attention to things that really matter, is that?",Let me put a sharper edge on that. They're actively devoting their attention to obstacles and thereby magnifying the obstacles rather than just slicing through them. It's like that attention creates more noise.,,Gideon-Patrice-GEI-Transcript.csv
315,6,12,"And the result of that would be? Like, what would the ultimate kind of worst thing about that would be what?","Not being able to focus on work everybody is there to accomplish. I mean, everything I've just described is very basic, but it's the basic building blocks of three months of embarrassing in action. One of the reasons that I joined ... I know that this is not staying under the microscope that you've focused in on, but I'm going to just do this. It's three months of ... I thought, ""Oh hey, I can do something and have other people who are dedicated to business development."" Well, the person who was brought on  to the business development did nothing, it was part of this I left.   The managing partner said he was going to take over and has brought in nothing. I have stepped back and said, ""As someone who is a little worn down and tired of business development, I'm pretty good at it. I can do that."" And       anyone who has come in the doo r, in this new job, has come in the door and spoken to me as the result of my own initiative, I thought that was not going to be the case, but it has been the case. And so to answer your question about why this relationship to time matters, I think it gets  right down to just being able to accomplish what we say we're here to do; recognizing a mission and executing it. Period.",,Gideon-Patrice-GEI-Transcript.csv
316,6,13,"So you said earlier, and you've just kind of edged towards it again, then this idea that you went into that role, I guess n ot really knowing how good you were at certain things and that this few months has highlighted for you that you are. How did that shift happen? Tell me a little bit about that. How you went from and to, and how you think that happened.","I went from  relating to business development as something that I was tired of and would gladly push off my plate if I didn't have to do it, and if there was someone else there to do it. I've come away recognizing not only am I fine at it, but I've just digested a who le body of knowledge related to the particular industry that I've been working in that has made it possible for me to sit down, have an hour long conversation with people who are very advanced in that industry and have them be very surprised that I'm not a  part of that.   And it has shown me that for this specialty industry, I was able to do that in about three months, I can do that for maybe not any, but most. This is a skill that I can just take, and with the right conversations, with the wonderful resour ce, that is the DC Public Library, I can probably digest any body of knowledge related to an industry and go in tailoring a coaching service line that feels just right to anyone in that industry.

318,6,15,"... Well, I was just curious around what kinds of things helped you know that? How did you start to see that? Was it other people giving you feedback? Was it just a sense within yourself that actual ly you know more about this thing you've got? What kind of thing helped, contributed to you knowing it's about this all?","It was a combination of all these things. One of the ... So the only coworker that I enjoyed working with, who has sadly left, was someone who worked at basically the number one institution in this industry in the world as well as the number one in DC. We spoke and she repeatedly expressed amazement at my ability to absorb information and make relevant connections to coaching. And  it was a profession that ... She did coaching as a profession, but she didn't know about ahead of time, was skeptical about ahead of time, and as a result of our collaboration, she did a complete 180 on that front and wants to continue finding ways to wor k together.         So to answer your question head on, a real leader in the field provided that confirmation. But it was also just the curiosity that I was bringing to my reading, like, it was just so fun. And to gobble down a few books a week and be able to have conversations about that with her on the one hand, but when I started to branch out and do networking of my own, including finding people that I'd never encountered before and coaching through this industry lens to them, they were gobsmacked.

And as a parent, I also really want to model for my son and daughter being someone who is okay with themselves, who doesn't have to live under a cloud of shame for not doing the right thing or compromising their values. And I don't know how much they're paying attention to it, but I figure they see a lot, they see everythin g and I'm not prepared to  model what feels like a compromised approach to life for them.

I'm curious, can you imagine a time or a situation where it would be a good idea to let go of those standards?","Yeah, and as I was describing them, I was also thinking to myself, ""Wow, what a privileged point of view."" But I think there are a couple of situations that come immediately to mind. One, if I were uncertain about whether I'd be able to provide for them,  I might ease up on those standards, that's not the case right now. I'm clear that the situation right now is just one where I'm being less effective than I could be outside of the situation, and so it's just kind of a no brainer.

332,6,29, what's coming to mind?,"Well, and it's less of the heat thing and more of the opportunity. I think I briefly alluded to this at the very beginning, but because of all of this heat, it finally had things start clicking yesterday that maybe this is the time to just reevaluate everythi ng that I've done. I had given up my lease, my office lease going into this new role and it has been the thing that has been weighing most heavily on me. Like, can I get it back? Should I ask for it back? And I realized yesterday, just walk away from it. Y es, you loved your neighbors, and I really loved the neighbors in the office space, but how cool would it be to just treat this as an opportunity to rewrite everything? And ...",,Gideon-Patrice-GEI-Transcript.csv
333,6,30,What could be the best thing about rewriting everything?,I don 't know yet.,,Gideon-Patrice-GEI-Transcript.csv
334,6,31,This sounds exciting.,"Yeah. Let's talk in a year. But I'll give you an example of how just over the past few months of even being in the situation that I'm ready to walk away from, stepping back has caused me to rethink how I  offer coaching experience. I've like completely redone the office, turned it into a high class experience. Thought       about how, for instance, the best restaurants treat you when you come in, and tried to a crib as much as I could from those models.   And th at's something I never would have done before, never would have done if I had been just kind of stuck on my own as a solopreneur. So even as I complain and undermine everything I've said about respect, it's been a tremendous opportunity to do that. And I'm  thinking to myself, ""Well, if I did that while dealing as much duress as I did, imagine the levels I can take it to just by stepping back and stripping everything away and reconceiving of what I do and why I do it.""",,Gideon-Patrice-GEI-Transcript.csv
335,6,32,"And if you were to do all of that, which sounds exciting to me too, what would be the most delightful thing about doing all of that?","I promise I'm not just copying what you said, but I think doing it for its own delight. I think the way I've been feeling about work for the la st three months has really been a prison for me to look at a lot of things; one of which is, just how much I enjoy the very act of coaching. If I were not dependent on making a living and if that were taken care of, you bet I would be there doing something  like coaching many hours a day just for the sheer joy of it.   And I think I'm truing up the possible sense of delight to my everyday activities, that would be the benefit of doing it. And just figuring out ways to support that delight flooding in, and ha ving people recognize it. And having people, comes back to the first thing I started harping about, just creating room for people to respect themselves and respect what matters to them.",,Gideon-Patrice-GEI-Transcript.csv
336,6,33,"So if you had to choose, and I offered to other people exper iencing, and may be you know the coaching experience is terrific and how it's helping them grow, if you had to choose between that and the delight you get out of it yourself, and the kind of bigger picture of how that coaching interaction can influence stu ff happening, which of those three, if I had to force you to choose, would you choose?","Even though I didn't mention the third one, it would definitely be the third one. It would definitely be the third one. And I remember about a year and a half a go coming to the realization that something had shifted in my view on coaching. When I first started doing it professionally in 2011, 2012, I thought, ""Oh wow, the sky is the limit. I can talk to all kinds of people."" And then finally I realized that you g ot to think about this in terms of your own mortality too. There is a finite number of conversations that you are going to have and man, you got to make it stick.   This is what you're here to do. And I felt an urgency that I had never felt before when the  world seemed like it was my oyster. And you know what, this ties back to the time and respect conversation. I've been coaching less over the last three months than I had before, and that completely messes with the sense of       urgency I started feeling a year  and a half ago to really bring what I have to bring to people who could use it.",,Gideon-Patrice-GEI-Transcript.csv
337,6,34,"So I'm going to go in a slightly different direction, I just wanted to play there for a little bit. When you think about the people you've been waiting for and the CEO there, how do you think they would see themselves in what's happening now? Because with the time thing, with the pay thing, how do you think they see themselves in those situations?","I mean, there isn't much left to the imagination because I've had very candid conversations about this with them. There is a mentality of being the victim of their own poor choices, victim of other people taking advantage of them.

341,6,38,"Perfect, that's totally cool. Looking back on the conversation we had, what's occurring to you now that maybe wasn't occurring to you at the beginning? Is there anything else you'd like to explore other than that situation?","Well, when Diana sent the prompts for the initial homework for the conversations at the Growing Edge course, I started writing out things that had nothing to do with this, and I realized, ""Oh wow, here are three situations that are just completely the same, leading to the same realization."" And I went to sleep over afterwards, and I keep on waking up to the same routes, and recognizing that there's always a high around it, but it's just the same thing in different forms. And then I started going bac k and just thinking about what are pivotal moments in my life where I knew myself differently as a result of them?         There's one situation where I found out when I was 10 years old that my mom was ready to divorce my father. And I kept it secret for like s ix months from anyone, including my sister, and that was very impactful. And this was on my brain because I mentioned the colleague that I was really fond of, and basically she had confided to me that she was going to leave, and I was like, ""Oh my God, it's that dynamic all over again. Isn't that funny?""",,Gideon-Patrice-GEI-Transcript.csv

348,6,45,I was just testing for that for you.,"Yeah. No, because I've been there, done that, and I've ex perienced the wreckage of going in whole hog and thinking this is it, and then ...

there in – in Ken Wilbur’s terms, there’s  - there’s two ways to be present to information and knowledge, and one is in translation, where you accumulate more,  and more, and more, and become more proficient, and – and say, “Oh, well, look  what I know now ” There’s almost an arrogance to that He didn’t say that, I did Whereas there’s this other pole where the translation is – is horizontal, and you just keep filling it up, like a library of Congress, and the vertical pole is for transformative, in which – in which, one’s participation in knowledge and information is  transformative, and consciousness raising And, initially the group wanted translation; so did I What is it you understand about love About this, that, and the other And so that’s a very legitimate dance to make, as – as people get acquainted But, I then found that people wanted to stay in the translation, and  - and my invitation not to abandon that, not leave that behind, but then to have the – the kinds of  - of questions and -  and wond – not questions, pondering and wondering that can lead to the emergence of transformation To make – to make surrender to transformation, as compared to sort of controlled translation, um, so I – no, I – I – I don’t seem, I  don’t seem to know how See, I’m not sure what to… I don’t seem to be in a place in which people ponder, and wonder They – there are so many bright people, so many smart people, who seem to be driven to conclude And that works well if you’re a doctor and you need to diagnose something, um, your brilliance and your wisdom, dah, dah, dah But, to ponder and to wonder, and to be taken  temporarily… I – this last summer, I went to  for a bluegrass festival and stopped in On the way back, I stopped for a four-day conference in  called “” My second attendance It’s an annual affair It started  years ago, first private for five years, and then became public It started with a Leroy Little Bear, an elder in the Blackfoot tribe of Montana and Canada, and David Bohme, the British physicist And Leroy Little Bear had read some of the works of David Bohme, especially on Bohmian dialogue, and said, “I – I – I have to meet this man This – this is incredible His – his physics is what we talk about in Blackfoot language ” And he said “In Blackfoot language, we don’t have any nouns We have just verbs, you know We don’t try and grab up reality and hold it in language as if they were things And everything’s in process, and that’s what Bohme was talking about Bohmian dialogue and physics” So, they met And just fell in love with each other Just – just so excited to find this meeting of the minds Same as when   by tone of voice, choice of words, and then, the next person who takes the microphone, the talking stick, is not – is not obligated to answer in any way other than to honour what that person said, that – that this now is not my time to show my brilliance This is not my platform This is not a performance I need to honour what that person said, and what Leroy Little Bear initiated, and make my heartfelt comments Over three days, intention has been the dialogue, becomes the leader, not some structural process Dialogue is giving birth to Leroy’s question, and then as a nine-month pregnancy, it just evolves, and develops, and increasingly, that’s  – that’s the only place I really become willing to – to talk Because people listen And they consider And they allow the question It’s not even question… the invitation, to infuse them And allow their wisdom to speak, or their wondering, or “I don’t know, gimme time to think about that”, or… But, I – I don’t mind that At least it’s one model , that idea of dialogue, even introduced, let alone mentored, in almost any social institution through which we’re all processed , whether it be family, church, or schooling, or work, and then it certainly is not encouraged in any social situation I‘ve ever been in, in which one is instructed to deliberately stay incredibly shallow, social, “How are you doing How are the kids ” Uh, but this is not the time and place for really being touched I think I’m still on your question about do I find…

TIME WHEN IT WAS EASIER FOR YOU TO FEEL SATISFIED IN  MORE EVERYDAY SPACES, AND WHETHER YOU MISS THAT Um, if I were to generalize, I’d say that there’s been very few times in my life, in  which I’ve been satisfied with who I was, or who I understood who I was in my  relationships with people, except – except when I was giving I was a medic, in the , I was a teacher, father, lover, neighbour, gardener, and friend, so that, and  although this is increasingly true now, um, … What – what I understood people wanted me to give, wasn’t satisfying They didn’t want what I had to offer, but I meant… Um, back to this man was loved like he discovered cultures, and he just got greedy I was loved as long as I would swim through the conventional culture, as long perfected the expected scripts As long as I didn’t invite touching… As long as I didn’t suggest that fucking wasn’t loving Could be, but alone isn’t Um, as long as I didn’t suggest and invite that Christmas didn’t need to be an orgy So, my whole life has been one in which, for the most part, I’ve learned that what I now have, and give freely, and enjoy, and just let people take, or not And they most often do I didn’t have that, most of my life It could have been ineptness on my part It could have been a lack of skill, it could have been a lack of sensitivity to other people’s social needs, uh, but now it just seems so
